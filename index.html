        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Pat loves cookies. Pat loves Seattle. Pat loves salmon.<br /> One day, Pat decided to put all his loves together and came up with salmon cookies. These delectables soon became so popular amongst his family and friends, Pat decided to share them with the rest of his Seattle community. Now we are established at five locations in the Greater Seattle area. In addition to cookies, we have apparel and all the tools you need to make salmon cookies, right in your own kitchen.
